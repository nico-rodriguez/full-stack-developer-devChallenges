## Features

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/N1fvBjQfhlkctmwj1tnw) was to build an application to complete the given user storie.

## Overview

## Getting started

After grabbing a local copy of the repository, you can start the backend server in development or production mode, by issuing either `npm run start:dev` or `npm run start` respectively, from inside `backend/` folder.

The difference between development and production modes is that the session storage mechanism. In the first, the session is stored in a local Redis database; in the later, it's stored in-memory, through the `memorystore` package.

In regard to the session, a secret must be provided in order to verify the authenticity of each user session (it's used to sign the session cookie).

The user data is stored in a MongoDB.

### Environment variables

The application expects certain environment variables:

```bash
MONGODB_URL=<string>

# Redis configuration only needed in development mode
REDIS_HOST=<string>
REDIS_PORT=<number>

# Secret for signing the session cookie
SESSION_SECRET=<string>

# OAuth
# GitHub
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<string>
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=<string>
```
